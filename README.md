Collaboration of findings and work assigned for Smart India Hackathon


# Summary 
Clean rivers are mandatory for the existence of the living beings as it is the basic necessity which everyone is dependent on. 
cleaning the rivers of India is such a tidious process that recquires various steps such as:-
- Collecting water samples
- testing the samples
- Reporting it to authorities for further process.


Higher authorities need to maintain these records and generate statistically inferred reports for taking the effective actions. 
   
   Our solution takes up this challenge and tries to digitize it. In our proposed solution concerning these following problems:-
- sample takers could submit their reports using our mobile web application after logging in. They can submit various insights such as ( ph level, ammonia level, salt level, oxygen level, dissolved metals, etc) to the centralised database.
- Higher authorities could login on our web application and check the automatic generated statistically inferred graphs and charts of the submitted data and take the appropriate actions regarding it.
- field reporters could attach the geo tagged photographs of water samples with their reports.
- Mobile application will work offline to save the given reports and submit it to the database when it connects to the Internet. Hence it would work in remote locations where connectivity is an issue.
 
So kindly present us with an opportunity to implement our proposed idea and save the sacred rivers of India.
